# LessTest Blog Content Strategy

## 🎯 Editorial Mission
Position LessTest as the thought leader in "frictionless testing" by speaking directly to developer pain points uncovered in our research.

## 📊 Content Pillars (Based on Research)

### 1. Pain Point Validation (Authority)
- Document the real struggles developers face
- Use data from Reddit/HN research
- Be the voice that says "we see you"

### 2. Competitive Transparency (Trust)
- Honest comparisons with Playwright/Cypress
- Show where they excel vs where they fall short
- No FUD—just facts

### 3. Philosophy & Culture (Differentiation)
- Testing as "inner loop" not "CI chore"
- Developer experience as first-class concern
- Zero-config as a philosophy, not a feature
