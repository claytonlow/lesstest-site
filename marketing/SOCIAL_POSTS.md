## 📝 Reddit Post Templates

### Template 1: The "Problem/Solution" (Best for r/webdev)
**Title:** Is anyone else struggling with flaky tests in CI?
**Content:** Pushing code and then waiting 12 minutes for a CI pipe to turn green is the worst. I decided to build LessTest to solve the "Zero Config" and "Speed" problem. It uses native ESM and distributable execution. Would love to know how you guys are handling flakiness right now.

### Template 2: The "Show & Tell" (Best for r/javascript)
**Title:** Meet LessTest: A test runner built for the speed of thought.
**Content:** Imagine your test suite ran as fast as your linter. That was the goal. No config files, no boilerplate, just `npx lesstest`. 

## 🚀 Product Hunt Hook
"Testing shouldn't be a chore. LessTest gives you the power of Playwright without the weight. Zero Config, Ultra-fast, Human-readable."
